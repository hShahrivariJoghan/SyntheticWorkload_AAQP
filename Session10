In this session, the tuner must realize to include extra columns in sample of photoobjall to reuse the sample for answering the following queries

select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.ra between 0 and 3
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.rerun > 0
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.clean>0
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.field >10 and s.rerun = 0
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.field >10 and s.run = 0
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.type >10 and s.rerun = 0
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.field >10 and s.psfmag_u = 0
select count(*) as count from  photoobjall s where s.dec >10 and s.rerun = 0
